# PROSIM: Tracking a lost educational simulation from 1968

**The educational production management simulation PROSIM remains digitally lost**, with no preserved copies located in any major software archive despite extensive searching. However, this research uncovered significant new academic sources, confirmed the Ohio thesis exists, identified living contacts who may have materials, and established the complete publication history and version lineage of this pioneering business simulation.

## New sources discovered in this research

This investigation found several previously unidentified sources that document PROSIM's history and influence:

**ABSEL Proceedings and Academic Papers:**
- **Johnson & Hendrick (1975)**: "OMSIM: An Operations Management Game" directly references PROSIM and PROSIM V, classifying them among the earliest production/operations management simulations. Available at: https://absel-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/absel/index.php/absel/article/view/2786
- **Biggs (1986)**: "Computerized Business Management Simulations for Tyros" includes PROSIM in its comprehensive bibliography of available business simulation packages. PDF at: https://absel-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/absel/article/download/2070/2039
- **Fritzsche & Burns (2001)**: "The Role of ABSEL in the Development of Marketing Simulations" references Greenlaw's simulation work extensively: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/104687810103200107

**Paul Greenlaw Obituary (2005):**
The obituary published in the Centre Daily Times confirms Greenlaw was "an internationally recognized pioneer at the cutting edge of the development of educational business simulations." It names **Dr. William D. Biggs** as one of his doctoral students, who stated: "He touched the lives of thousands of students directly through his teaching and the simulations he developed." URL: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/centredaily/name/paul-greenlaw-obituary?id=26678227

**Greenlaw's Foundational Text (1962):**
*Business Simulation in Industrial and University Education* (Prentice-Hall, 1962), co-authored with Herron and Rawdon, is **cited in dozens of academic papers** as the foundational work on business game design. This book predates PROSIM and likely contains algorithmic approaches used in its construction. Copies available through AbeBooks: https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Business+simulation+industrial+university+education

**Springer Citation Confirming 1991 Edition:**
A Springer book chapter cites "Greenlaw, P.S., Hottenstein, M.P. and Chu, Chao-Hsien (1991) PROSIM, A Production Management Simulation. 2nd Ed., Harper Collins" confirming Chu's involvement began with the second edition, not the third Windows version: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-35089-9_17

## The Ohio thesis exists and can be retrieved

The thesis "**PROSIM VIIj: AN ENHANCED PRODUCTION SIMULATION**" definitively exists in the OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations system with accession number **ohiou1171474745**. The title appeared in search results (confirming "VIIj" rather than "VII"), but the ETD system is currently under maintenance showing: "NOTICE: This site is down for maintenance."

**Recommended retrieval paths:**
1. **Contact OhioLINK Support**: 1-800-627-6420 to inquire when maintenance ends
2. **Ohio University Interlibrary Loan**: (740) 593-2699 can provide a copy using accession number ohiou1171474745
3. **Permanent URL format**: https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ohiou1171474745

The "VIIj" designation suggests this was version 7.j—indicating PROSIM evolved through at least **seven major versions** between 1968 and whenever this thesis was written, far more extensive development than previously documented.

## Complete PROSIM version history now established

Research confirms PROSIM underwent continuous development over nearly 30 years:

| Version | Year | Publisher | ISBN | Platform | Authors |
|---------|------|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| PROSIM | 1969 | International Textbook Co. | 978-0700222247 | IBM FORTRAN | Greenlaw, Hottenstein |
| PROSIM V | 1971 | (Referenced in literature) | — | Mainframe | Greenlaw, Hottenstein |
| PROSIM 2nd ed. | 1991 | Longman/Harper Collins | 978-0060424985 | — | Greenlaw, Hottenstein, Chu |
| PROSIM III | 1996 | Irwin Professional Pub | 978-0256214352 | Windows 3.1/95 | Chu, Hottenstein, Greenlaw |
| PROSIM VIIj | Unknown | Ohio University thesis | — | Unknown | Unknown author |

The 1975 OMSIM paper describes PROSIM (1969) as "beginning to moderate complexity" while PROSIM V (1971) is classified as "complex"—indicating significant expansion of the simulation model within just two years.

## Living contacts and potential sources for materials

**Michael P. Hottenstein (co-author, still living):**
- Professor Emeritus, Supply Chain and Information Systems, Smeal College of Business
- Contact via Penn State Smeal College institutional directory: https://directory.smeal.psu.edu/m7h
- Confirmed in his 2021 tribute to Chu that he collaborated on PROSIM development
- **Best prospect for locating documentation or software copies**

**Dr. William D. Biggs (Greenlaw's doctoral student):**
- ABSEL Fellow since 1988, still active in simulation research through 2024
- Professor Emeritus at Arcadia University (contact via institutional directory)
- Presented at ABSEL conference in 2022
- Studied under Greenlaw and may have materials or knowledge of where documentation exists

**Penn State University Archives:**
- Penn State Special Collections, phone: 814-865-1793
- May hold distinguished faculty papers from Greenlaw and Hottenstein
- Worth inquiring about Smeal College Business archives

## Software preservation status confirmed negative

**Extensive searching found no preserved copies** of PROSIM in any major abandonware or software preservation archive:

- **Internet Archive (archive.org)**: Not found
- **WinWorld (winworldpc.com)**: Not found
- **Vetusware (vetusware.com)**: Not found
- **MyAbandonware**: Not found
- **Old-Games.com**: Not found (1051 simulation games checked)
- **AbandonwareDOS**: Not found
- **Macintosh Garden**: Not found (no Mac version ever existed)

The software's educational distribution model (bundled with textbooks, instructor diskette required) and publisher absorption (Irwin → McGraw-Hill) contributed to its non-preservation. Physical copies with intact diskettes occasionally appear on Amazon UK for approximately £25-26.

## ABSEL archives as primary academic resource

The **ABSEL proceedings archives** at https://absel-ojs-ttu.tdl.org/absel/issue/archive contain the richest collection of academic references to PROSIM and Greenlaw's simulation work. Key resources:

- **Bernie Keys Library**: Historical proceedings from 1974-present, searchable full text
- Papers discussing functional business simulations (marketing, production, finance)
- Multiple citations of Greenlaw's 1962 book and 1973 teaching effectiveness study
- Historical context placing PROSIM among contemporaneous simulations (The Decision Making Game, JOBLOT, OMSIM)

Bernie Keys, ABSEL founder, mentions playing "The Executive Game by Greenlaw and others" on an IBM 360 in the 1960s: https://bernard.com.br/en/interviews/interview-bernie-keys/

## Assessment and recommendations

**Likelihood of locating original software: Low but not impossible**

The software itself remains unpreserved in digital archives. Best prospects:
1. Direct contact with **Michael Hottenstein** via Penn State Smeal College directory—he explicitly confirmed PROSIM collaboration and is the only living original author
2. Purchase of physical textbook with intact diskette from used book markets
3. Penn State University archives or Smeal College collections

**Likelihood of locating documentation: Moderate**

The Instructor's Manual (ISBN 978-0256214369, 194 pages) would contain the most detailed algorithmic documentation. Paths to explore:
1. WorldCat library holdings search for instructor edition
2. Used book dealers (BetterWorldBooks, AbeBooks show Greenlaw titles)
3. Hottenstein or Biggs may retain personal copies

**Recommended immediate actions:**
1. **Request Ohio thesis** via ILL using accession ohiou1171474745
2. **Contact Hottenstein** via Penn State Smeal College directory explaining the reconstruction project
3. **Contact Biggs** via Arcadia University directory as a secondary contact
4. **Search WorldCat** for instructor manual holdings at academic libraries
5. **Monitor** Amazon UK for textbook+diskette listings

The discovery of PROSIM VIIj in the Ohio thesis database is particularly significant—this enhanced version may contain documentation of algorithms and design decisions that could inform reconstruction efforts, and should be prioritized for retrieval once OhioLINK maintenance concludes.
