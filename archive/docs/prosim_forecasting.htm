<p>Chapter Four in the ProSim book is concerned with sales forecasting for your
company.&nbsp; The long term forecasting techniques used is the exponentially
weighted moving average (EWMA) technique.&nbsp; All the equations are worked out in the
chapter, and the final forecasts for product X appears in Table 4.5 on page 45.</p>
<p>To receive a full 100 points on this lab, construct the required
tables and provide the demand forecasts for products Y and Z for the next year,
similar to what is shown in Table 4.5 for X's.&nbsp; I will check it against the
solution.&nbsp; If you can recreate the same forecast that is provided for X's,
then you should get it right.&nbsp; Table 4.5 is correct to the 0.00 decimal
place on all columns.</p>
<p>To receive 80 points, use the technique shown on page 46:
Approximation Approach to Long-term Forecasting.&nbsp; You will need to know the
Trend values <i><b>T<sub>t</sub></b></i> for each product.&nbsp; They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>X:&nbsp; 328</li>
  <li>Y:&nbsp; 220</li>
  <li>Z:&nbsp;&nbsp; 169</li>
</ul>
<p>All I would like to get from you are tables that shows: (for Y and Z)</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
<ol>
  <li>January&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,453</li>
  <li>February&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10,668</li>
  <li>March&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15,443</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</li>
</ol>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on until December.&nbsp; (the numbers above are actually from X's.&nbsp; Yours will
be different).&nbsp; Please note also that your forecast values for product X
may differ by slight amounts to those shown in Table 4.6.</p>
